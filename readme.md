# Accelerate group 4 project "TheAnonymousConfessRoom"
---
**"TheAnonymousConfessRoom"** is an online social platform for creating anonymous confessions, appealing to injustice, and giving constructive advice to the "criminals" and the "victims". It would be an ideal place for seeking advice and encouragements because posts are made anonymously and inappropriate content will be filtered. The main purpose of the platform is not for personal attack or public trial but instead, to come up with constructive solutions for problems and help each other in the society. Everyone could be an angel to others.
>"Ups and downs are so normal in our life but sometimes we just don't know what to do and we even need a tree hole for releasing our sorrow and seek for advice. It is so easy to fall into a black hole if you don't actively seek for help."

By encouraging the sharing of thoughts to help each other in the society, this platform aims at linking people together and making the world better.
**Just for fun, may the "Confessions" be ever in your favor!**
